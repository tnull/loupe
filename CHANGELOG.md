# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Keep model credentials outside agent sandboxes by routing Claude and Codex through a host-side model broker ([#59]).
- Deny provider-side `mcp_servers` connections at the model broker ([#60]).
- Add guarded schema v3 for the v2 review harness, preserving legacy data and queued work; require an offline server upgrade with no leased jobs (see the [upgrade runbook](contrib/upgrading-schema-v3.md)) ([#61]).
- Reject unknown persisted job kinds at startup and explain incompatible schema versions ([#61]).
- Add typed, transactional review-harness storage with bounded text, semantic identities, replay records, and project-scoped proof metadata; keep unsupported job kinds readable but inert ([#62]).
- Log the database schema version and runtime image revision at server startup ([#62]).
- Add campaign-aware review scheduling with frozen budgets, resumable survey batches, bounded fair claims, and deadline handling while preserving legacy leasing.
- Add guarded schema v4 with lossless inventory paths and retained typed review evidence; preserve historical records (see the [offline upgrade runbook](contrib/upgrading-schema-v4.md)).
- Expose authenticated pre-proof survey, drilldown and verification APIs with transaction-bound authority, independent checkpoints, bounded context and finishing-worker receipt replay. Current workers advertise no phase capabilities and production triggers remain legacy.
- Add attempt-bound checkout preparation, resumable lossless manifests and immutable review-profile publication; retain durable deferrals for unsupported successor work.
- Admit pending work by risk at claim time, protect urgent and mandatory verification capacity, and commit validated lease responses with their assignments and one-time charges. Preserve unfinished evidence through retries, cancellation and exhausted budgets.
- Retain canonical verification evidence and render phase reports literally after commit; preserve operator delivery recovery without redispatching terminal replay.
- Allow explicit quiescent reset of incompatible derived generations without dropping canonical findings, mandatory verification intent or replay history.

## v0.1 — 2026-09-07

First release of Loupe, a security-scanning harness for source repositories.
Initial development established the server, workers, and admin CLI; mutual TLS;
encrypted storage; scheduled scans; Claude and Codex agents; finding
deduplication and verification; and GitHub, email, or manual reporting.

- Fix formatting and lint failures in CI ([#3]).
- Preserve base64 padding when loading deployment secrets ([#4]).
- Fix DNS resolution inside agent sandboxes ([#6]).
- Fix documentation formatting flagged by Clippy ([#7]).
- Add Docker deployment support for servers and workers ([#8]).
- Bundle trusted TLS roots so GitHub reporting works out of the box ([#9]).
- Add token and server certificate rotation, and retries for failed reports ([#10]).
- Improve per-finding GitHub reports, including PoCs and suggested fixes ([#11]).
- Add a configurable verification default for newly registered repositories ([#12]).
- Add worker configuration files and configurable agent settings ([#13]).
- Improve source discovery across project layouts, exclusions, and large files ([#14]).
- Terminate agent subprocesses when their requests time out ([#15]).
- Restrict permissions on worker credential bundles ([#16]).
- Show the newest results last in CLI lists ([#17]).
- Prioritize verification jobs over new scans ([#18]).
- Remove severity prefixes from GitHub issue titles ([#19]).
- Create namespaced severity labels for GitHub reports ([#20]).
- Document LLM usage costs and the impact of scanning large repositories ([#21]).
- Recover missing verification jobs and discard partial findings from failed scans ([#23]).
- Support Codex API-key authentication in workers and deployment helpers ([#24]).
- Discover in-repository Cargo packages outside workspace membership ([#25]).
- Extend verification retries to stalled and deadline-dismissed findings ([#26]).
- Include the reviewed revision in reports and document the project Discord ([#27]).
- Refresh repositories before checkout and verify findings at their original revision ([#28]).
- Add .NET project support to source discovery ([#29]).
- Centralize job and finding lifecycle transitions in storage ([#30]).
- Include server rejection reasons in worker errors ([#31]).
- Add configurable row limits to CLI list commands ([#32]).
- Allow explicit agent selection for scan and verification jobs ([#33]).
- Harden agent sandboxes, credentials, and tool boundaries against prompt injection ([#34]).
- Allow scans to proceed with unfollowed submodules and symbolic links ([#39]).
- Add a local web dashboard for repository, job, and finding management ([#44]).
- Isolate worker network access and add role-specific Debian host setup ([#55]).
- Include the MIT and Apache 2.0 license texts ([#56]).
- Move the server container to Debian Trixie ([#57]).
