//! Wire-format DTOs for loupe.
//!
//! Every DTO request and response carries a `protocol_version: u16` so
//! a mismatched server/worker pair fails loudly at the application
//! layer rather than silently mis-parsing. The URL prefix (`/v1`) and
//! the `X-Loupe-Protocol` request/response header cover routes whose
//! request body is empty or query-string only.
